# stock-management-system
This is a personal stock management system that individuals can use to track their stock portfolios. Users can monitor the number of stocks they've purchased, those they've sold, their overall investments, profits and losses on each stock, and more.

I've utilized Rails for the backend and Angular for the frontend, with Sqlite3 as the database.
To Run Backend: After changing to Api Directory
Rails setup:
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

rails server to run

To Run Frontend: 
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

To start
ng serve
